# ID Token Propagation

There isn't much point in propagation just an ID token. You have to get an access token to get an id token, so access token propagation makes more sense. 

See [https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/01/11/sso-oauth-vertx](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/01/11/sso-oauth-vertx) to see how to decode an ID token.
